description: In this way it bridges a gap from, say, a sholem aleichem to, well, the
  urban american jewish humor that has had such a profound influence on our culture.
  But beyond the satirical brilliance and nuance of this book i would like to commend
  it as simply enormously fun and readable. It's social vision is sophisticated and
  strangely contemporary and it is funny. Our main character is enormous, ridiculous,
  ferocious and fascinating, someone you sort of root for in a state of horror, but
  i love how he is not invincible, and the person to whom he is vulnerable (if you
  can call it that, probably it is all part of da costa's (our hero's) plans) expresses
  for me the touch of sweetness that just keeps the humanity of the book afloat. The
  story is told in tight, marvelously put together chapters that nearly stand on their
  own. The plot work has that wonderful tight and suprising gearlike quality that
  is so satisfying to read.
